== Required Software
As X50Q is only supported to use with Windows, we would need additional software to get this up and running.

* link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] or any similar software
* link:https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/software-download/windows10ISO[Windows 10], as an alternative Windows 7 should also be possible to use.
* link:https://www.wireshark.org/download.html[Wireshark], make sure to install link:https://desowin.org/usbpcap/[USBPcap] during installation of Wireshark

Another really helpful application can be link:https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/[Notepad++] with installed link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/nppjsonviewer/[JSONViewer] plugin to read and compare the exported json dumps.

How to setup the noted software will not be described in this document, as this is a really straight forward task and there are lots of link:https://bfy.tw/OjCO[instructions] out there.

To bind the keyboard into the VM the VM has to be up and running. If the VM is started click `Devices -> USB` in the top bar and select the X50Q as shown in the picture below.
